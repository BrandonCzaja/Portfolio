Hello, and welcome to my blog! Please allow me to introduce myself. My name is Brandon Czaja and I am a recent graduate of General Assembly's Software Engineering Immersive Bootcamp. Prior to completing the program I worked as an Art Handler at prestigious museums both in Chicago and Boston, utilizing my Museum Administration Graduate Certificate from Tufts University in Medford, Massachusetts.

One of the things I enjoy most about programming is the large community of friendly people. During my time at General Assembly I met a lot of great people, both as students and instructors. As the course progressed I got to know many of them and would truly consider them friends. It was fun talking code with them and sharing resources; I always felt so cool when I shared a resource that everyone got a lot of use out of. And that is the inspiration for this blog. As I learn and grow in my new field I hope to be a reliable source of knowledge for the community.

Thank you again for visiting my blog.

Brandon
